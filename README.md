chinese-name-generator-for-girls
================================

###This is an easy program to generate pretty, dulcet and elegant Chinese names (female only for now)###

It takes into account the appearance, tone and meaning of each chosen character.
To use this, please download the "chi_name_gen.rb" file and run it from your shell. Like this:

<code>
  cd chi_name_gen
  ruby chi_name_gen.rb
</code>

I have tested it both on Win 8 (Ruby 1.9.3) and Ubuntu 12.04 (Ruby 2.0.0). However, I cannot have it run on Codecademy Labs or other online shell yet. (Perhaps some problems with the Chinese characters)

Please feel free to help improve it. Thank you!
